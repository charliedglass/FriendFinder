# FriendFinder
In the FriendFinder App, we use `express` to handle routes and match you with your closest friends!

You have the option to go to the survey page from the home page.  After you fill out all the required fields in the survey, a modal pops up suggesting the best friend match for you in the database.

You can see the list of all the possible friends by clicking on the link `API Friends List` on the home or survey page.
